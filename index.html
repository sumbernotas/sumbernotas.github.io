                <h1>CS-499 CAPSTONE</h1>
                <h1>Self Assessment</h1>

                <p>Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have
                    developed a comprehensive
                    skill set that combines technical expertise with professional competencies essential for success in
                    the software development field.
                    This ePortfolio represents the culmination of my academic growth and demonstrates my readiness to
                    contribute meaningfully to the tech
                    industry. The capstone experience has been particularly exciting, allowing me to utilize and
                    integrate
                    knowledge from multiple courses while
                    refining my abilities in software design, algorithm implementation, and system architecture.
                </p>

                <h2>Collaboration and Stakeholder Communication</h2>
                <p>My experience in collaborative environments has been fundamental to my professional development. I
                    learned to
                    work effectively within Agile frameworks by participating in sprint planning,
                    daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
                    I was taught the importance of clear communication, conflict resolution, and shared
                    accountability. Practical experience was also gained by
                    using version control systems like Git, understanding how branching strategies and pull requests
                    facilitate team collaboration while also
                    maintaining code quality. Beyond formal team projects, I've developed strong stakeholder
                    communication skills through courses like
                    CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle, where I learned to translate technical concepts into
                    more simplistic language for non-technical
                    audiences. I practiced writing user stories, acceptance criteria, and project documentation that
                    bridged the gap between business
                    requirements and technical implementation. This ability to communicate effectively across different
                    levels of technical
                    understanding has become one of my most valuable professional assets.

                <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
                <p>My foundation in data structures and algorithms has been strengthened through multiple courses,
                    particularly <a href="https://github.com/sumbernotas/ABCU-Course-Planner" target="_blank">CS-260:
                        Data Structures and Algorithms.</a> Here I've developed proficiency in analyzing algorithmic
                    complexity using
                    Big O notation and understanding
                    when to apply different data structures based on performance requirements. Working with arrays,
                    linked lists, trees, hash tables, and
                    graphs has also given me the analytical framework to make informed decisions about system design.
                    Throughout my courses,
                    I implemented various sorting and searching algorithms and gained hands on experience with their
                    practical applications. They have taught me to
                    balance theoretical knowledge with real-world constraints and understand that optimal solutions
                    often depend on specific use cases. This analytical mindset has become integral to
                    my problem-solving approach, allowing
                    me to evaluate trade-offs and justify design decisions with quantifiable metrics.
                </p>

                <h2>Software Engineering and Databases</h2>
                <p>My software engineering education has emphasized not just writing code, but architecting
                    maintainable, scalable systems. In <a href=https://github.com/sumbernotas/CS-320-SoftwareTestQA
                        target="_blank">CS-320:
                        Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance</a>, I learned test-driven development
                    practices and
                    wrote comprehensive unit tests
                    using JUnit. I developed an appreciation for code coverage metrics, regression testing, and the
                    importance of automated testing in
                    continuous integration pipelines. This experience taught me that quality assurance isn't an
                    afterthought but is instead an integral part of
                    the development process.<br><br>
                    Database management skills were cultivated through <a
                        href="https://github.com/sumbernotas/CS340-Client-Server-Dev" target="_blank">CS340:
                        Client/Server Development</a>, where I worked
                    extensively with MongoDB and
                    MySQL. I learned to design normalized database schemas, write complex queries, and optimize database
                    performance through indexing and
                    query analysis. I also gained experience with RESTful API design, understanding how to create
                    efficient interfaces between front-end
                    applications and back-end databases. The combination of database expertise and API development has
                    prepared me to work effectively in
                    full-stack development environments.
                </p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>Security consciousness has been heavily present throughout my education, but <a
                        href="https://github.com/sumbernotas/CS405-SecureCoding" target="_blank">CS-405: Secure Coding
                        provided</a>
                    focused expertise in this critical area.
                    I learned to identify common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and buffer
                    overflows, and more importantly, how to
                    prevent them through secure coding practices. I gained experience with input validation,
                    authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques.
                    Understanding the OWASP Top 10 and implementing security best practices has become second nature in
                    my development process.<br><br>
                    Additionally, in <a href="https://github.com/sumbernotas/PetBag" target="_blank">IT-145: Foundations
                        in Application Development</a>, I learned about access control, data
                    protection, and the principle of least
                    privilege. These concepts reinforced that security isn't a feature to be added laterâ€”it must be
                    designed into systems from the ground up.
                    This security-first mindset influences every line of code I write and every system I design.
                </p>

                <h2>Professional Goals and Values</h2>
                <p>Developing this ePortfolio has significantly impacted my professional goals and values. I am
                    committed to
                    writing clean, maintainable code that
                    solves real-world problems efficiently. I value continuous learning, recognizing that the technology
                    field evolves rapidly and staying
                    current requires dedication and curiosity. I believe in collaborative development practices that
                    leverage diverse perspectives to create
                    better solutions. Most importantly, I am committed to ethical software development that considers
                    user privacy, accessibility,
                    and societal impact.<br><br>
                    This capstone experience has shown me that I'm ready to contribute to professional development
                    teams,
                    whether working on enterprise
                    applications, web services, or mobile platforms. I'm prepared to adapt to new technologies and
                    frameworks while applying the fundamental
                    principles I've mastered throughout this program.
                </p>

                <h2>Artifacts Overview</h2>
                <p>This ePortfolio contains three artifacts that collectively demonstrate my technical versatility and
                    growth as a software developer.
                    Each artifact has been carefully selected and enhanced to showcase different aspects of my computer
                    science capabilities:<br><br>

                    <B>Artifact One: Rescue Animal System - Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</B><br>
                    The first artifact demonstrates my software engineering and design skills through the transformation
                    of a command line appointment system (originally from CS-320) into a comprehensive
                    full-stack web application. The original project used a simple command line interface with in-memory
                    HashMap storage and basic CRUD operations. For Enhancement One, I completely redesigned the
                    architecture using Spring Boot as the application framework and implemented the
                    Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for proper separation of concerns. I developed a professional
                    web interface using Thymeleaf templating engine and Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, creating an
                    intuitive user experience for healthcare facilities to manage patients and appointments. The
                    enhancement includes a multi-layered architecture with distinct Controller, Service, and Repository
                    layers, each with clearly defined responsibilities. I implemented comprehensive server side
                    validation using validation annotations, including regex pattern validation for names (letters,
                    spaces, hyphens, apostrophes only), phone number format validation, email format
                    validation, and future date validation for appointments. The application features automatic ID
                    generation for patients (PAT1001, PAT1002...) and appointments (APT2001, APT2002...), ensuring
                    unique identification throughout the system. This artifact showcases my ability to apply modern
                    software design patterns, implement RESTful-style routing, create professional user interfaces, and
                    transform legacy code into production-ready applications following industry best practices and SOLID
                    principles.<br><br>

                    <B>Artifact Two: Binary Search Tree Implementation - Algorithms and Data Structures
                        Enhancement</B><br>
                    The second artifact focuses on algorithms and data structures through significant enhancements to a
                    Java-based Rescue Animal management system originally developed in IT-145. I transformed the basic
                    procedural program with ArrayList storage into a sophisticated system utilizing custom-implemented
                    binary search trees for optimal performance. The key enhancements include replacing String types
                    with appropriate datatypes (int for age, double for weight, LocalDate for dates),
                    implementing an enum-based TrainingStatus system to ensure valid values and type safety, and
                    expanding the system from supporting two animal types to four (dogs, monkeys, cats, and birds)
                    through proper inheritance hierarchies. Most significantly, I implemented a generic AnimalBinaryTree
                    class with recursive insertion, searching, and deletion operations, along with various tree
                    traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order). I created an AnimalTreeManager class that
                    maintains separate binary search trees for each animal type, providing efficient search operations
                    with O(log n) average-case complexity compared to the original O(n) linear searches. The
                    implementation includes advanced search capabilities by multiple criteria including training status,
                    country (both acquisition and service), and age ranges, plus tree performance analytics including
                    height calculation and complexity analysis. I added methods to retrieve available animals (in
                    service and not reserved) efficiently across all trees. This artifact showcases my algorithmic
                    thinking, understanding of computational complexity and Big O notation, ability to implement
                    recursive algorithms, and skill in optimizing system performance through appropriate data structure
                    selection while maintaining clean, maintainable code.<br><br>

                    <B>Artifact Three: Database Integration and Security Enhancement</B><br>
                    The third artifact demonstrates my database management and security expertise by integrating MySQL
                    database functionality into the Medical Appointment Application from Artifact One. The original
                    Enhancement One version still used in-memory HashMap storage, meaning all data was lost when the
                    application restarted. For Enhancement Three, I designed and implemented a normalized relational
                    database schema with two main tables: patients (storing patient information) and appointments
                    (storing appointment records with patient relationships). I integrated Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
                    ORM to handle object-relational mapping, allowing seamless interaction between Java objects and
                    database tables through JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Column, @Id, @GeneratedValue). The
                    implementation includes a Repository layer using Spring Data JPA's repository pattern, which
                    automatically generates CRUD operations and custom query methods. I added comprehensive transaction
                    management using @Transactional annotations to ensure ACID compliance and data integrity across
                    operations. The enhancement includes automatic audit timestamps (created_at, updated_at) on all
                    records, providing a complete audit trail for compliance requirements. I implemented critical
                    security features including SQL injection prevention through JPA's parameterized queries (prepared
                    statements), input sanitization using regex pattern validation, and prevention of malicious input
                    through Bean Validation constraints. The database integration includes proper indexing on primary
                    keys and unique constraints on business identifiers (patient_code, appointment_code) for query
                    performance optimization. Connection pooling is managed automatically by Spring Boot's HikariCP for
                    efficient resource utilization. This artifact showcases my ability to design normalized database
                    schemas, implement ORM frameworks, write secure database interactions, manage transactions, and
                    create production-ready persistent storage systems that maintain data integrity while protecting
                    against common security vulnerabilities.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Together, these three artifacts demonstrate the full range of my computer science capabilities. They
                    show progression from foundational software design through advanced algorithm implementation to
                    comprehensive system integration with security considerations. Each enhancement builds upon the
                    previous work, creating a cohesive narrative of increasing complexity and sophistication.<br><br>
                    The artifacts illustrate my ability to:<br>

                solve complex problems. As I transition from academic study to professional practice, I am confident
                in my ability to contribute effectively to software development teams, adapt to new technologies and
                methodologies, and continue growing as a computer science professional. The skills and mindset
                developed throughout this program have prepared me not just for my first role in the field, but for
                a career of continuous learning and technical excellence.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please

                <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
                <p>This artifact is a comprehensive web-based system for managing patients and their appointments. It is
                    an enhancement of
                    my original project completed in CS-320 Software Testing and QA. Originally, the project was
                    command-line only, no UI,
                    that provided basic CRUD operations for contacts, tasks, and appointments using only service classes
                    and JUnit testing.
                    My enhanced artifact is a full-featured Spring Boot web application with user interface, validation,
                    and professional software architecture.
                </p>

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it was actually one of my favorite projects completed
                    within my time at SNHU. I thoroughly
                    enjoyed learning about testing and how to implement that into my skills as a developer. The project
                    from CS-320 itself was a wonderful foundation
                    for a full application as well, so transforming it from a basic service oriented application into a
                    full stack web application not only shows
                    significant growth in myself as a developer but allowed me to come back to a project I really
                    enjoyed. <br><br>

                    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Design:</span> I implemented a MVC (model view controller)
                    pattern. The service later handles business logic, the controller layer manages web
                    requests and responses, and Thymeleaf templates provide the presentation layer. This all
                    demonstrated my understanding of enterprise level
                    architecture principles! I also implemented proper entity relationships with ID generation using
                    AtomicLong for safety and data validation
                    in regard to database design. This directly was enhanced from my original project and demonstrated
                    my understanding of data modeling! <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Framework:</span> I successfully integrated Spring Boot,
                    Spring MVC, and Thymeleaf which showcases my ability to work with Java frameworks.
                    User experience: Using Boot Strap I was able to include an interface with intuitive navigation,
                    success and error messages, and confirmation
                    dialogs to show consideration for end-user experience. This showcases my ability to create a quality
                    user experience which is vital to professional
                    development <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Testing:</span> Using JUnit 5, I covered validation
                    scenarios, edge cases, and logic verification which demonstrated my ability and commitment to QA
                    and test-driven development principles. <br><br>

                    My artifact was improved through several enhancements such as replacing command line interface with
                    a web interface, implementing proper
                    validation with user-friendly messages, adding full CRUD operations for patients and appointments,
                    and establishing comprehensive error handling throughout the application.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>The process of enhancing this artifact provided learning experiences that extended far beyond
                    technical skill development. This was my
                    very first time truly working with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf and while it was extremely intimidating
                    at first, I learned how to understand
                    documentation and implementation of new systems and software much better. While I did push myself
                    out of my comfort zone with this project,
                    I worked endlessly and passionately which ended up being very fulfilling and worth it. I was faced
                    with many challenges though, my most
                    technically demanding being debugging the Thymeleaf template errors I was getting, particularly in
                    understanding why my form objects were
                    failing. To fix this, I had to dive very deeply into Springâ€™s model attribute handling and
                    Thymeleafs expression language which led me to have
                    a better understanding of what was going wrong and how to fix it. Managing the relationship between
                    AppointmentService and PatientService in the
                    testing environment was another substantial challenge. The dependency injection that works
                    seamlessly in the running application did not function
                    in unit tests, requiring me to implement manual dependency injection using reflection. Overall, I am
                    significantly proud of myself with this
                    enhancement for many reasons. With a lot of dedication, I managed to create a whole full-stack
                    application using new software all while being
                    on a time crunch. This week taught me that professional software development goes far beyond just
                    writing functional code, and while the process
                    may seem daunting or impossible, it is possible with the right passion and dedication.

                <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
                <p>The artifact enhanced for this category is the Rescue Animal Management System, originally developed
                    during my IT-145 Foundations
                    in Application Development course. The original system was a basic Java console application designed
                    to manage rescue animals
                    (dogs and monkeys) using simple ArrayList data structures for storage and linear search algorithms
                    for data retrieval. My enhanced
                    version represents a complete transformation by implementing binary search tree data structures to
                    replace the inefficient
                    ArrayList-based storage system. The enhanced system now supports four animal types (dogs, monkeys,
                    cats, and birds) with advanced
                    search capabilities, comprehensive validation systems, and performance monitoring features.
                </p>

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a deep understanding of data
                    structures and algorithms while showcasing
                    practical problem solving skills that are essential in professional software development. The
                    transformation from a basic linear storage
                    system to an optimized tree based architecture illustrates several key ideas that align perfectly
                    with the Data Structures and Algorithms
                    enhancement category. <br><br>

                    Algorithm Optimization: The most significant improvement is the replacement of O(n) linear search
                    algorithms with O(log n) binary
                    search tree operations. This change demonstrates my understanding of computational complexity and
                    the practical impact of algorithm
                    selection on system performance. For a system with 100 animals, searches that previously required up
                    to 100 comparisons now require a
                    maximum of 7 comparisons which is a dramatic 14x performance improvement. <br><br>

                    Advanced Data Structure Implementation: The creation of a generic AnimalBinaryTree&ltT&gt" class
                    showcases my ability to implement
                    complex data structures from scratch. The tree includes sophisticated features such as recursive
                    insertion and deletion algorithms,
                    in-order traversal for automatic sorting, and multi-criteria search capabilities. This
                    implementation demonstrates understanding of
                    type safety and reusable code design principles. <br><br>

                    System Architecture Enhancement: The development of the AnimalTreeManager class illustrates my grasp
                    of software architecture patterns.
                    This manager provides an interface for multiple binary search trees while maintaining separation of
                    concerns and complex tree operations.
                    Scalability and Extensibility: The system expansion from two to four animal types, each with
                    specialized attributes and validation logic,
                    demonstrates my ability to design scalable solutions. The architecture allows for easy addition of
                    new animal types without disrupting
                    existing functionality.

                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Enhancing this artifact was a really enjoyable experience for me as I got to implement a binary
                    search tree which I have not done in quite
                    a while. While this was a much smaller scale project than my first enhancement, I did reach some
                    challenges when designing the tree manager
                    to handle multiple animal types efficiently while maintaining type safety. Initially, I considered
                    creating separate manager classes for
                    each animal type, but this approach would have led to san unnecessary amount of code duplication. My
                    solution was to use a generic tree
                    implementation with a unified manager interface which required careful consideration of inheritance
                    relationships and generic type parameters.
                    Another challenge I had was managing the complexity of the enhanced system while maintaining
                    usability. The original system's simplicity was
                    part of its appeal, and adding sophisticated features without overwhelming the user required careful
                    interface design. This experience taught
                    me the importance of balancing functionality with user experience. Overall, this enhancement was
                    truly an upgrade to the original, basic PetBag
                    system and I got to touch base on concepts I havenâ€™t touched in a while. The transformation from a
                    simple ArrayList-based system to a
                    sophisticated tree-based architecture demonstrates not only technical competency but also the
                    analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities
                    that define effective software engineering.

                <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
                <p>This artifact is a comprehensive web-based system for managing patients and their appointments. It is
                    an enhancement of my
                    original project completed in CS-320 Software Testing and QA. Originally, the project was
                    command-line only, no UI, that
                    provided basic CRUD operations for contacts, tasks, and appointments using only service classes and
                    JUnit testing. My enhanced
                    artifact for category three is a continuation of enhancement one which was converting it into a
                    full-featured Spring Boot web
                    application with user interface, validation, and professional software architecture. The
                    continuation for this enhancement is
                    that instead of the application using in-memory, it officially uses a persistent MySQL database by
                    utilizing Spring Data JPA with hibernate.
                </p>

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>As stated before, I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it was one of my favorite projects
                    I've completed within my time at
                    SNHU. It also provided an ideal foundation to demonstrate database design, integration, and security
                    competencies which are fundamental
                    skills to professional software development. The artifact's existing service layer architecture,
                    established validation logic, and clear
                    separation of concerns created the perfect structure to add a persistence layer without requiring a
                    complete rewrite. The Medical
                    Appointment domain is particularly well suited for demonstrating database concepts because it
                    includes multiple related entities,
                    referential integrity requirements, business rules requiring validation, audit requirements, and
                    security considerations protecting
                    sensitive medical information. <br><br>

                    Design: I created normalized relational database schemas with two tables (patients and appointments)
                    featuring appropriate data types,
                    constraints, primary keys with auto-increment, unique constraints on business identifiers, and audit
                    columns providing complete history
                    trails. This demonstrated my understanding of proper database design and data modeling principles.
                    <br><br>
                    ORM with JPA and Hibernate: I implemented entity mapping using JPA annotations, lifecycle callbacks
                    for automatic timestamp management,
                    and Hibernate configuration including dialect selection and DDL auto-generation. This showcased my
                    ability to bridge object-oriented code
                    with relational databases. <br><br>
                    Repository Pattern: I created repository interfaces extending JpaRepository for automatic CRUD
                    implementation and custom query methods
                    using Spring Data JPA naming conventions. This demonstrated my understanding of data access
                    abstraction and modern persistence patterns.
                    Transaction Management: I implemented declarative transaction management using @Transactional
                    annotations to ensure data consistency and
                    ACID compliance. This showcased my ability to handle complex database operations safely. <br><br>
                    Security: I implemented input sanitization through pattern validation to prevent SQL injection
                    attacks, combined with multi-layered
                    validation throughout the application. This demonstrated my security-conscious development
                    practices. <br><br>

                    My artifact was improved through several key enhancements as compared to even my enhancement one by
                    replacing the in-memory HashMap
                    storage with a persistent MySQL database, implementing Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for ORM, adding
                    automatic audit timestamps for
                    tracking changes, establishing transaction management for data consistency, and implementing
                    comprehensive input validation and SQL
                    injection prevention. The enhancement transformed the application from a volatile, development-only
                    tool into a persistent, production
                    ready system capable of handling real world healthcare scenarios.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This enhancement was actually less challenging than the other two because I had already created the
                    foundations for this one in the
                    first enhancement. Adding the persistent database felt more like a natural update of the app rather
                    than a complete overwrite. I had
                    this enhancement planned out from the start of this course, so I developed my first enhancement with
                    this one in mind. While I did face
                    some challenges with the initial MySQL installation and configuration, these were primarily
                    infrastructure, and user error issues rather
                    than architectural challenges. The implementation of the database itself actually went quite
                    smoothly!
