                <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
                <p>This artifact is a comprehensive web-based system for managing patients and their appointments. It is an enhancement of 
                    my original project completed in CS-320 Software Testing and QA. Originally, the project was command-line only, no UI, 
                    that provided basic CRUD operations for contacts, tasks, and appointments using only service classes and JUnit testing.
                     My enhanced artifact is a full-featured Spring Boot web application with user interface, validation, and professional software architecture.
                </p>

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it was actually one of my favorite projects completed within my time at SNHU. I thoroughly 
                    enjoyed learning about testing and how to implement that into my skills as a developer. The project from CS-320 itself was a wonderful foundation 
                    for a full application as well, so transforming it from a basic service oriented application into a full stack web application not only shows
                    significant growth in myself as a developer but allowed me to come back to a project I really enjoyed. <br><br>

	                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Design:</span> I implemented a MVC (model view controller) pattern. The service later handles business logic, the controller layer manages web 
                    requests and responses, and Thymeleaf templates provide the presentation layer. This all demonstrated my understanding of enterprise level 
                    architecture principles! I also implemented proper entity relationships with ID generation using AtomicLong for safety and data validation 
                    in regard to database design. This directly was enhanced from my original project and demonstrated my understanding of data modeling! <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Framework:</span> I successfully integrated Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Thymeleaf which showcases my ability to work with Java frameworks.
                    User experience: Using Boot Strap I was able to include an interface with intuitive navigation, success and error messages, and confirmation
                    dialogs to show consideration for end-user experience. This showcases my ability to create a quality user experience which is vital to professional 
                    development <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Testing:</span> Using JUnit 5, I covered validation scenarios, edge cases, and logic verification which demonstrated my ability and commitment to QA 
                    and test-driven development principles. <br><br>

                    My artifact was improved through several enhancements such as replacing command line interface with a web interface, implementing proper 
                    validation with user-friendly messages, adding full CRUD operations for patients and appointments, and establishing comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>The process of enhancing this artifact provided learning experiences that extended far beyond technical skill development. This was my 
                    very first time truly working with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf and while it was extremely intimidating at first, I learned how to understand 
                    documentation and implementation of new systems and software much better. While I did push myself out of my comfort zone with this project, 
                    I worked endlessly and passionately which ended up being very fulfilling and worth it. I was faced with many challenges though, my most 
                    technically demanding being debugging the Thymeleaf template errors I was getting, particularly in understanding why my form objects were 
                    failing. To fix this, I had to dive very deeply into Spring’s model attribute handling and Thymeleafs expression language which led me to have 
                    a better understanding of what was going wrong and how to fix it. Managing the relationship between AppointmentService and PatientService in the 
                    testing environment was another substantial challenge. The dependency injection that works seamlessly in the running application did not function 
                    in unit tests, requiring me to implement manual dependency injection using reflection. Overall, I am significantly proud of myself with this 
                    enhancement for many reasons. With a lot of dedication, I managed to create a whole full-stack application using new software all while being 
                    on a time crunch. This week taught me that professional software development goes far beyond just writing functional code, and while the process 
                    may seem daunting or impossible, it is possible with the right passion and dedication.

                </ul>

                <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
                <p>The artifact enhanced for this category is the Rescue Animal Management System, originally developed during my IT-145 Foundations 
                    in Application Development course. The original system was a basic Java console application designed to manage rescue animals 
                    (dogs and monkeys) using simple ArrayList data structures for storage and linear search algorithms for data retrieval. My enhanced 
                    version represents a complete transformation by implementing binary search tree data structures to replace the inefficient 
                    ArrayList-based storage system. The enhanced system now supports four animal types (dogs, monkeys, cats, and birds) with advanced 
                    search capabilities, comprehensive validation systems, and performance monitoring features.
                </p>

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms while showcasing 
                    practical problem solving skills that are essential in professional software development. The transformation from a basic linear storage 
                    system to an optimized tree based architecture illustrates several key ideas that align perfectly with the Data Structures and Algorithms 
                    enhancement category. <br><br>

                    Algorithm Optimization: The most significant improvement is the replacement of O(n) linear search algorithms with O(log n) binary 
                    search tree operations. This change demonstrates my understanding of computational complexity and the practical impact of algorithm 
                    selection on system performance. For a system with 100 animals, searches that previously required up to 100 comparisons now require a 
                    maximum of 7 comparisons which is a dramatic 14x performance improvement. <br><br>

                    Advanced Data Structure Implementation: The creation of a generic AnimalBinaryTree&ltT&gt" class showcases my ability to implement 
                    complex data structures from scratch. The tree includes sophisticated features such as recursive insertion and deletion algorithms, 
                    in-order traversal for automatic sorting, and multi-criteria search capabilities. This implementation demonstrates understanding of 
                    type safety and reusable code design principles. <br><br>

                    System Architecture Enhancement: The development of the AnimalTreeManager class illustrates my grasp of software architecture patterns. 
                    This manager provides an interface for multiple binary search trees while maintaining separation of concerns and complex tree operations.
                    Scalability and Extensibility: The system expansion from two to four animal types, each with specialized attributes and validation logic, 
                    demonstrates my ability to design scalable solutions. The architecture allows for easy addition of new animal types without disrupting 
                    existing functionality.

                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Enhancing this artifact was a really enjoyable experience for me as I got to implement a binary search tree which I have not done in quite 
                    a while. While this was a much smaller scale project than my first enhancement, I did reach some challenges when designing the tree manager 
                    to handle multiple animal types efficiently while maintaining type safety. Initially, I considered creating separate manager classes for 
                    each animal type, but this approach would have led to san unnecessary amount of code duplication. My solution was to use a generic tree 
                    implementation with a unified manager interface which required careful consideration of inheritance relationships and generic type parameters. 
                    Another challenge I had was managing the complexity of the enhanced system while maintaining usability. The original system's simplicity was 
                    part of its appeal, and adding sophisticated features without overwhelming the user required careful interface design. This experience taught 
                    me the importance of balancing functionality with user experience. Overall, this enhancement was truly an upgrade to the original, basic PetBag 
                    system and I got to touch base on concepts I haven’t touched in a while. The transformation from a simple ArrayList-based system to a 
                    sophisticated tree-based architecture demonstrates not only technical competency but also the analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities 
                    that define effective software engineering.

                <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
                <p>This artifact is a comprehensive web-based system for managing patients and their appointments. It is an enhancement of my 
                    original project completed in CS-320 Software Testing and QA. Originally, the project was command-line only, no UI, that 
                    provided basic CRUD operations for contacts, tasks, and appointments using only service classes and JUnit testing. My enhanced 
                    artifact for category three is a continuation of enhancement one which was converting it into a full-featured Spring Boot web 
                    application with user interface, validation, and professional software architecture. The continuation for this enhancement is 
                    that instead of the application using in-memory, it officially uses a persistent MySQL database by utilizing Spring Data JPA with hibernate. 
                </p>

                <h2>Justification</h2>
                <p>As stated before, I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it was one of my favorite projects I've completed within my time at 
                    SNHU. It also provided an ideal foundation to demonstrate database design, integration, and security competencies which are fundamental 
                    skills to professional software development. The artifact's existing service layer architecture, established validation logic, and clear 
                    separation of concerns created the perfect structure to add a persistence layer without requiring a complete rewrite. The Medical 
                    Appointment domain is particularly well suited for demonstrating database concepts because it includes multiple related entities, 
                    referential integrity requirements, business rules requiring validation, audit requirements, and security considerations protecting 
                    sensitive medical information.  <br><br>

	                Design: I created normalized relational database schemas with two tables (patients and appointments) featuring appropriate data types, 
                    constraints, primary keys with auto-increment, unique constraints on business identifiers, and audit columns providing complete history 
                    trails. This demonstrated my understanding of proper database design and data modeling principles. <br><br>
                    ORM with JPA and Hibernate: I implemented entity mapping using JPA annotations, lifecycle callbacks for automatic timestamp management, 
                    and Hibernate configuration including dialect selection and DDL auto-generation. This showcased my ability to bridge object-oriented code 
                    with relational databases. <br><br>
                    Repository Pattern: I created repository interfaces extending JpaRepository for automatic CRUD implementation and custom query methods 
                    using Spring Data JPA naming conventions. This demonstrated my understanding of data access abstraction and modern persistence patterns.
                    Transaction Management: I implemented declarative transaction management using @Transactional annotations to ensure data consistency and 
                    ACID compliance. This showcased my ability to handle complex database operations safely. <br><br>
                    Security: I implemented input sanitization through pattern validation to prevent SQL injection attacks, combined with multi-layered 
                    validation throughout the application. This demonstrated my security-conscious development practices. <br><br>

                    My artifact was improved through several key enhancements as compared to even my enhancement one by replacing the in-memory HashMap 
                    storage with a persistent MySQL database, implementing Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for ORM, adding automatic audit timestamps for 
                    tracking changes, establishing transaction management for data consistency, and implementing comprehensive input validation and SQL 
                    injection prevention. The enhancement transformed the application from a volatile, development-only tool into a persistent, production 
                    ready system capable of handling real world healthcare scenarios.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This enhancement was actually less challenging than the other two because I had already created the foundations for this one in the 
                    first enhancement. Adding the persistent database felt more like a natural update of the app rather than a complete overwrite. I had 
                    this enhancement planned out from the start of this course, so I developed my first enhancement with this one in mind. While I did face 
                    some challenges with the initial MySQL installation and configuration, these were primarily infrastructure, and user error issues rather 
                    than architectural challenges. The implementation of the database itself actually went quite smoothly!
